# Online Tambola
This repository holds the source code for online multiplayer version of Tambola/Housie which can be played [here](http://example.com).

## Motivation
The motivation behind developing this was to create actual in-person Tambola experience online during this pandemic. All the other mobile versions either do not allow you
to play with your friends or if they do, then those games do not allow for the existence of Host of the game i.e. the person who manages the **Board** and **Awards**.
